# Custom .NET Webshop

![alt text](/biogains.jpg)

## Description

In this project we created a webshop in .NET MVC completely from scratch. The focus was not only on the technical solution, but 
also on following all (austrian) consumer laws. We did this extraordinary effort to create a basic webshop that can be used for 
following web projects, where one can assume that all judical precautions where considered and where we know every line of code,
therefore it was also a "the path is the goal" project.

## Built With

* [.NET MVC](https://www.asp.net/mvc) - Backbone of the whole system
* [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/sql-server/sql-server-2016) - Good choice when working with .NET and Visual Studio
